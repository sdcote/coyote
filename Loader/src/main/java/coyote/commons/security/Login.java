 * associations of principal to roles are maintained by the application and
 * modeled by this class.
 *
 * <p>Each login has one or more credentials to perform authentication by the
 * application. The set of roles in this class assists the application perform
 * role based authorization. The identifier of this class allows the
 * application to perform auditing by tagging this identifier to all
 * operational records and transactions. Authorization, Authentication and
 * Auditing are the foundation of all secure applications.
