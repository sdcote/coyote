/**
 * The AppEvent class models an base class for an occurrence to be noted.
 *
 * <p>AppEvents are used to store significant events in an application. These
 * are often errors which can easily get lost in log files. The Scorecard holds
 * events separately and allow the system to handle them in a manner apart from
 * simply recording them to a log file for later analysis.
 *
 * <p>A basic assumption is made that all applications are made up of systems
 * and those systems are made up of components. Each of these tiers can be
 * identified and the composite business key of application-system-component
 * can be used to identify the source of events in very large, complex
 * environments.
 *
 * <p>It is also assumed that operations uses the concept of codes to represent
 * events in a language independent manner. Events can contain a message for
 * local operations staff, but using a major-minor code key into a resource
 * file enables the use of language specific resources to be used in
 * representing the meaning of the event. Using a major code to categorize the
 * event can speed resolution workflows and automated processing while minor
 * event codes can give more details. It is very common in large data centers
 * to see troubleshooting manuals list resolutions by event codes and this
 * class continues support for this effective approach.
 *
 * <p>Scorecards hold a reference to a buffer of events. When an event is added
 * and the buffer is full, the oldest event is dropped to make room for the new
 * one. This keeps memory under control, but can cause problems during garbage
 * collection if the application is experiencing an event storm.
