<p>This is a Java toolkit so you need Java. On most linux systems you can call:
<pre>apt-get install oracle-java8-jdk</pre>

<p>Now that you installed the toolkit, you need to call it.

<p>Consider putting CoyoteDX in you path.

<p>To set a path for all users except root, edit /etc/profile or /etc/enviroment. For root or an individual user edit their .bashrc or .bash_profile in their home directories, respectively. Add the PATH=$PATH:/opt/tinydx/bin.

<p>If you installed the demonstration package, copy one of the configurations from the app.home/cfg/demo directory to app.home/cfg. Otherwise, copy a configuration from the website or other source into the configuration directory. Then run:<pre></pre>
tdx filename </pre>
Running from the command line loads the component in your configuration and runs it once. Install the daemon to setup a background process to run one or more jobs at regular intervals.
