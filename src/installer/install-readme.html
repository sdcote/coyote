<h1>Coyote DX</h1>

<h2>What it can do for you</h2>
<p>Coyote DX is a simplified data extraction, transform and loading toolkit for the 
Java[tm] platform which allows the creation of integration and mediation jobs. It 
uses a very modular architecture that lets you add your own components so the tool 
works as you want, not as the software requires it to work. It is possible to extend 
it to suit your needs and has been designed with this purpose in mind.</p>

<h2>Coding Optional</h2>
<p>A primary design consideration is this toolkit mut provide value without having 
to write any code. It is possible to edit a configuration file and specify a 
complete integration job with the existing tools contained in the product. This 
allows anyone to use the tool, not just developers.</p>

<h2>Write Your Own Components</h2>
<p>Coyote DX is based on a highly decoupled, modular architecture allowing the user
to write their own components to well-defined interfaces and call those components
from the configuration file. The Coyote Loader is a generic component manager which 
can be used for a wide variety of tasks and the Transformation Engine can leverage 
any user-developed components. This keeps all possibilities open.</p>

<h2>ToolKit, Not Just a Framework</h2>
<p>This is a collection of tools which can be used individually or in concert to 
achieve the level of functionality desired. Just need to read fixed	field length 
files? Just use the the classis in your code to do so. Want a more complete 
conversion routine? Use the Transform Engine to handle a more sophisticated 
conversion.</p>
