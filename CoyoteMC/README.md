# CoyoteMC

This is a metric collection toolkit for Coyote DX which allows the creation an processing of metrics. Use cases include the following:

* Monitor web sites (and services) for client-side performance metrics,
* Checking if infrastructre is operational, such as databases are available,
* Determining the response times for critical API and service calls.

This toolkit support making metrics available to Prometheus Time Series Data Base instances for alerting and reporting in a larger Application Performance Monioring (APM) solution.

It is expected that this will also feed many other APM solutions by providing a way to perform customized monitoring of infrastructures and systems.
