<h3>Initialization Script</h3>
<p>As root, make a symbolic link to the coyotedx script:<br> 
To create a new symlink (will fail if symlink exists already):<pre>
sudo ln -s /opt/coyotedx/bin/coyotedx /etc/init.d/coyotedx         
</pre>
To create or update the symlink:<pre>
sudo ln -sf /opt/coyotedx/bin/coyotedx /etc/init.d/coyotedx
</pre>

<h3>Link Initialization Script to Appropriate Run Levels</h3> 
execute the following command. This will add appropriate 'S' and 'K' entries in the given run-levels. This will also add appropriate sequence number by considering the dependencies.  
<pre>sudo update-rc.d coyotedx defaults</pre> 

<h4>Start the Service</h4>  
<pre>sudo service coyotedx start</pre> 

<p>Check the state of the service: 
<pre>sudo systemctl status coyotedx.service 
sudo journalctl -xn</pre> 

<p>After editing the script reload it: 
<pre>sudo systemctl daemon-reload</pre> 

<p>To check if the service is running, execute this command: 
<pre>service coyotedx status</pre> 

<p>The update-rc.d script installs or removes services from runlevels. Run the command below to enable the coyotedx Daemon Service: 
<pre>sudo update-rc.d coyotedx enable</pre> 

<p>Optional: you can have the service respawn if it ever crashes or is forcefully terminated by adding a respawn line for this service at the bottom of the /etc/inittab file: 
<pre>id:2345:respawn:/bin/sh /path/to/application/startup</pre> 

<p>Run the command below to disable the CoyoteDX Daemon Service: 
<pre>sudo update-rc.d coyotedx disable</pre> 

<p>Run the command below to remove all the appropriate 'S' and 'K' entries from the different run levels:
<pre>sudo update-rc.d coyotedx remove</pre> 

<p>Place the Job configuration in the daemon.json configuration and you can run it continually in the background. Just add a CronEntry to its configuration.

<p>The Wedge component can be replaced with your own components or once you have a Job configured. It is there only to keep the daemon running until you add your components. Without any jobs or components, the daemon will exit.
